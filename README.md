The goal of this analysis is to understand which location variables assist in determining most effective location tracking of customers based upon accessing public WIFI networks. In order to accomplish this goal, this report investigates the relationship between the following variables to determine which ones offer the most pertinent information to predict locations of customers and develop navigation system: Longitude, Latitude, Floor, Building ID (specific building), Space ID (specific space), Relative Position (location within a space such as internal or external), User ID, Phone ID, and Timestamp. Based upon the relationship of these previous mentioned variables and how they relate with the received signal strength of the network, this report offers specific recommendations as to which key locationing point will be vital in developing a comprehensive navigation system.  There were 527 attributes with over 2 million data points.
